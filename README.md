## Usage

Once installed, you can start using the GitHub Issue Tool. Below are some common commands to help you get started.

### Creating Issues

To create issues, run the following command:

```bash
github-issue-tool create --file issues.json
```

The `issues.json` file should contain an array of issues formatted as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Issue Title 1",
    "body": "Description for issue 1",
    "labels": ["bug", "help wanted"]
  },
  {
    "title": "Issue Title 2",
    "body": "Description for issue 2",
    "labels": ["enhancement"]
  }
]
```

### Managing Dependencies

You can also manage dependencies between issues by specifying them in the JSON file. For example:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Issue Title 1",
    "body": "Description for issue 1",
    "dependsOn": ["Issue Title 2"]
  },
  {
    "title": "Issue Title 2",
    "body": "Description for issue 2"
  }
]
```
